**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 4: August 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished CS50's lab 2, scrabble.

**Thoughts**  Officialy finished week 2!! onto week 3 hehe. When I did the lab, I was surprised since I finished it faster than I hoped. When I used check50 every test was already correct. Suffice to say I felt like a God.
