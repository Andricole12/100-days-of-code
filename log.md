**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: August 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the week 2 lecture of CS50. Started 2nd part of problem set 2, caesar.

**Thoughts** Got annoyed since some of the tests failed when I ran it on check50. I should have researched more on what the tests actually do but I'll leave it for tomorrow.
